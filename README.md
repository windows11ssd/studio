# ksatest Speed Test

This is a Next.js web application built to measure internet speed. It functions as a Progressive Web App (PWA), allowing for installation on various devices, and can be packaged as a native mobile app using tools like Capacitor.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
2.  **Run development server**: `npm run dev`
3.  Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) in your browser.

## Building for Production (Web)

Run `npm run build` to create an optimized production build. This project is configured for static export, so the output will be in the `out/` directory.

## Packaging as a Native Mobile App (Android APK / iOS)

This is a web application that can be packaged into a native mobile app. You cannot directly export an `.apk` or iOS app bundle from this Next.js codebase alone. Tools like PWABuilder or Capacitor are needed to wrap the web app.

**Using PWABuilder (Simpler for PWA-to-Store):**

1.  **Deploy your application**: Make sure your ksatest app is deployed to a publicly accessible HTTPS URL (e.g., using Firebase Hosting, Vercel, Netlify). The PWA features are already set up.
2.  **Go to PWABuilder**: Visit [pwabuilder.com](https://pwabuilder.com).
3.  **Enter your PWA URL**: Paste the deployed URL of your ksatest app into PWABuilder.
4.  **Analyze**: Let PWABuilder analyze your PWA manifest and features.
5.  **Package for Stores**: Navigate to the packaging options. PWABuilder can generate packages for Android (using Trusted Web Activity - TWA), iOS, and Windows.
    *   **Android**: Follow the steps to build an Android package. This will likely involve downloading generated source code that you can build into an APK/AAB using Android Studio.
    *   **iOS**: Packaging for iOS is more complex due to Apple's requirements. PWABuilder provides guidance, but it typically involves using Xcode and might require some native code adjustments.

**Using Capacitor (Recommended for more native capabilities):**

To package this Next.js application as a native Android or iOS app using Capacitor, follow these steps in your terminal:

1.  **Install Capacitor CLI (if not already installed globally or locally):**
    ```bash
    npm install @capacitor/cli
    ```
    It's also good to install core and platform packages:
    ```bash
    npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/android @capacitor/ios
    ```

2.  **Initialize Capacitor in your project:**
    Run this command in the root of your ksatest project:
    ```bash
    npx cap init ksatest com.example.ksatest
    ```
    (Replace `ksatest` with your app name and `com.example.ksatest` with your desired app ID if different). This will create a `capacitor.config.ts` (or `.json`) file.

3.  **Configure `capacitor.config.ts`:**
    Open the generated `capacitor.config.ts` file. This project is configured for static export (`output: 'export'` in `next.config.ts`). After building the Next.js app, the static web assets will be in the `out/` directory.
    Modify `capacitor.config.ts` to set the `webDir` property to `'out'`:
    ```typescript
    // capacitor.config.ts
    import type { CapacitorConfig } from '@capacitor/cli';

    const config: CapacitorConfig = {
      appId: 'com.example.ksatest', // Or your chosen app ID
      appName: 'ksatest',        // Or your chosen app name
      webDir: 'out',              // Point to the Next.js static export directory
      server: {
        androidScheme: 'https'
      }
    };

    export default config;
    ```

4.  **Add the native platforms:**
    ```bash
    npx cap add android
    npx cap add ios  # If you also plan to build for iOS
    ```
    This will create `android/` and/or `ios/` directories in your project, containing the native project files.

5.  **Build your Next.js app for static export:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command executes `next build`, which (due to the `output: 'export'` configuration) will generate the static web assets in the `out/` directory.

6.  **Sync your web assets with the native platforms:**
    ```bash
    npx cap sync
    ```
    This command copies your web assets from the `out/` directory into the native Android and iOS projects. It also updates dependencies and configurations.

7.  **Open the native project in its IDE:**
    *   For Android:
        ```bash
        npx cap open android
        ```
        This will open the Android project in Android Studio.
    *   For iOS (macOS only):
        ```bash
        npx cap open ios
        ```
        This will open the iOS project in Xcode.

8.  **Build the APK/AAB (Android) or iOS App:**
    *   **Android (in Android Studio):**
        *   Wait for Gradle sync to complete.
        *   You might need to configure signing keys for a release build.
        *   Use the "Build" > "Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)" > "Build APK(s)" (for testing) or "Build Bundle(s)" (for Play Store) menu option in Android Studio.
    *   **iOS (in Xcode):**
        *   Select your target device or simulator.
        *   Configure your development team and signing certificates.
        *   Click the "Play" button (Build and Run) or use Product > Archive for a release build.

    **Note:** You will need to have Android Studio (for Android) and/or Xcode (for iOS, on macOS) installed and properly configured on your machine to perform this step.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Native Functionality:** If you need to access native device features beyond what PWAs offer (like the real cell tower info you inquired about previously), you would need to write Capacitor plugins or native modules. This involves Java/Kotlin for Android or Swift/Objective-C for iOS.
*   **Updates:** When you update your web app code, you'll need to run `npm run build`, then `npx cap sync`, and then rebuild the native app through its respective IDE.

By following these steps, you can wrap your Next.js web application into a native Android (APK/AAB) or iOS application.
