/**
 * Asynchronously retrieves cell tower information.
 *
 * **IMPORTANT NOTE ON REAL CELL TOWER DATA:**
 * Obtaining real-time, specific cell tower information (like Cell ID, LAC, MCC, MNC)
 * that a user's device is actively connected to is **generally not possible**
 * directly from a web application or Progressive Web App (PWA) like this one.
 *
 * **Why?**
 * - **Security and Privacy:** Web browsers sandbox web applications and restrict access
 *   to low-level network and hardware details to protect user privacy and device security.
 * - **Platform Limitations:** Web APIs (`navigator.geolocation`, etc.) provide location
 *   data (GPS, Wi-Fi based, IP-based) but do not expose specific cellular network parameters
 *   of the serving cell.
 *
 * **Native Apps vs. Web Apps:**
 * Accessing this level of detail typically requires native mobile application permissions
 * and specific platform APIs (e.g., `TelephonyManager` on Android or CoreTelephony on iOS),
 * which are not available to web applications.
 *
 * **What this function does:**
 * This function returns **simulated or example data** for `CellTowerInfo`. The values for
 * `cellId` and `lac` are randomly generated, and `mcc` and `mnc` are static examples.
 * This is intended for UI demonstration and layout purposes only.
 * **It does not, and cannot (due to web platform limitations), reflect the actual
 * cell tower the user's device is connected to.**
 *
 * If real cell tower information is a critical requirement, the application would need
 * to be developed as a native Android/iOS app, or potentially explore backend services
 * that might aggregate such data (though still unlikely to be real-time for a specific user's
 * connection without native app integration).
 *
 * @returns A promise that resolves to a `CellTowerInfo` object containing
 *          **simulated or example data**, not real-time information.
